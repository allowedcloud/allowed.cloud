Notes on the IAM service for AWS
<!-- EXCERPT END-->

With IAM, you can manage AWS permissions for workforce users and workloads. For workforce users, we recommend that you use AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) to manage access to AWS accounts and permissions within those accounts. AWS SSO makes it easier to provision and manage IAM roles and policies across your AWS organization. For workload permissions, use IAM roles and policies, and grant only the required access for your workloads.
